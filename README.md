# Insertion Sort Notes :
**The time complexity for insertion sort isn't always O(n^2) ----> worst case
let's assume that the array is (almost)sorted , clearly , the inner while loop will never be executed
so , it will be O(n) ----> Best case

**Also note that the inner loop is executed (partially or fully ) most of the time 
So, the average case is also O(n^2).
